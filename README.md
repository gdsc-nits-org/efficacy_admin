## Introduction

Do the ill-informed students enquire too much about the events and attend too little out of incognizance? Are you fed up of posting and reposting the details of the same event on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook over and again? Have you yourself lost track of the events you ‘have concluded’, ‘are managing’ and are ‘to host’?
No problem!

Introducing the Efficacy Admin app – the ultimate answer to all your queries above. Leaving the tedious pin-ups of events, campaigns and fests redundant, you can now micromanage all the events you have concluded, are presently managing and those upcoming across an array of platforms with provisionary measures for greater ease – all within Efficacy! The app provides amazing features aimed at drastically reducing the hassles faced by an average student by laying across the spread of all the events of institute life on a single easy-to-access user-friendly platform.
